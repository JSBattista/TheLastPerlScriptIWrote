# TheLastPerlScriptIWrote
This is the last Perl script I wrote after 2 years of writing thousands of lines of Perl. RIP Perl. 
Back in early 2002, my last Perl job gone, and nothing much else to do at that time, I decided to see if I could create a program to generate Lotto numbers for me. The premise was that while entirely random on the relative instances of occurence, there was still a "reality trend" of sorts. 
The Perl script attempted to map these trends using all previous Florida lottery numbers up to that point. Nothing has been written to this or updated since. I just found it all in an old file. 
The last Perl I ever wrote. 
I did dabble in "higher order" Perl a few years later but did not write anything for work or real use.
